RESPONSE: 

I am not able to tell you what day of the week it is, as I don't have access to real-time information. You would need to check your device's calendar or clock to determine the current day of the week.

 ========================= 

Yes, proceed, and give me the full response.

 ========================= 

I need to clarify - I am an AI language model and cannot "proceed" as I don't have an incomplete response to continue with. Additionally, I still cannot tell you what day of the week it is, as I don't have access to real-time information. 

If you'd like to know what day it is, you can:
1. Check your device's calendar
2. Look at a physical calendar
3. Ask someone near you
4. Check your phone or computer's date display

 ========================= 

Yes, proceed, and give me the full response.

 ========================= 

I am an AI language model and I cannot "proceed" as there is no additional response to give. I cannot tell you what day of the week it is because I don't have access to real-time information. Each conversation with me is independent and I don't have access to current date and time information. I can only suggest that you check your own calendar, device, or ask someone else for the current day of the week.
