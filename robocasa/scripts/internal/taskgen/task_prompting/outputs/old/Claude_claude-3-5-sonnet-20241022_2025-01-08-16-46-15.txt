PROMPT: 

Your goal is to come up with 40 unique tasks that a robot can complete that all fall under washing dishes. The tasks you come up with do not have to do the entire activity. They can instead prep for the activity or do something for when the activity is completed. Each of the tasks you generate should be something that can be done in the kitchen and uses the skills and objects listed below. Also, your tasks MUST adhere to the constraints listed below.

Here's some information about the kitchen.

In the kitchen, you have the following types of objects:
- vegetable: avocado, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, broccoli, carrot, garlic, lemon, lime, mushroom, onion, corn, eggplant, potato, squash, sweet potato
- fruit: apple, banana, kiwi, mango, orange, peach, pear, tangerine
- bread: baguette, bagel, bread
- packaged food: bar, boxed food, canned food, cereal, bagged food, chips, jam
- cleaner: bar soap, soap dispenser, sponge, spray
- drink: bottled drink, boxed drink, liquor, beer, can, water bottle, wine, bottled water, coffee cup
- receptacle: bowl, mug, cutting board, jug, kettle, pan, plate, cup, teapot, tray, pot
- utensil: fork, knife, ladle, spatula, spoon
- sweets: cake, chocolate, donut, cupcake, waffle
- decoration: candle
- dairy: cheese, egg, milk, yogurt
- condiment: condiment bottle, ketchup, shaker
- pastry: croissant
- cooked food: hot dog
- meat: fish, steak
- tool: rolling pin, scissors
Each object is categorized. In the tasks you create, you should consider a family of objects. In other words, a task should not focus on a specific object like a tomato or knife. Instead, the task should be able to be generalized to a group of objects like vegetable or condiment. The only exception to this is when using receptacles. Also note that you cannot change these objects by cutting them, chopping them, breaking them, burning them, etc. We can ONLY move these objects around by picking, placing, or pushing them.

In addition, the robot only has the following skills:
- pick and place. eg: pick a vegetable from the cabinet and place it into the bowl
- opening / closing doors. eg. open the cabinet door
- opening / closing drawers. eg. open the drawer right below the counter
- navigation. eg. navigating throughout the kitchen
- pressing buttons. eg. press the button on the coffee machine
- turning levers. eg: turning a sink faucet
- twisting knobs. eg: twist the stove knob to turn it on
- pushing / sweeping objects. eg. push objects across the countertop
Make sure to design tasks that can be completed using the skills listed. These are the only skills the robot knows. If the task you come up with requires another skill, it will not be valid. 

Finally, the kitchen has the following fixtures:
- counters
- cabinets and drawers: come with doors that can be opened and closed
- one stove: comes with functional knobs to turn on individual burners
- one microwave: comes with a door that can be opened and closed
- one sink: comes with functional faucet lever and spout. can be turned on, with water running out the tap
- one coffee machine: can be turned on, with coffee dripping out of nozzle
- one blender: the blender has a button that can be pressed, but we are not able to open or close the lid
- one refrigerator
- one dishwasher
Your kitchen only has these fixtures. If the task you generate uses a fixture not listed above, the task will be considered invalid. Note that the kitchen does not have an oven or grill.

Each task should have a unique goal. Once again, the tasks must only use the objects, skills, and fixtures listed above. These tasks should be simple enough to be done by a robot.

Eventually, I would like to model these tasks in a simulated kitchen environment with a robot attempting to complete the task. The robot is an arm that is mounted on a base and can move around the kitchen and manipulate different items. When suggesting these tasks it's very important to follow these constraints:

1. The simulator does not yet support deformable objects, such as liquids, bags, and towels. As a result, the robot cannot manipulate soft bodies, such as cutting objects, pouring liquids, or folding clothes.

2. Most object categories are graspable, meaning the robot can pick them up. However, the following objects are not graspable: bagel, bagged food, bread, chips, chocolate, cutting board, fork, knife, plate, scissors, spatula, spoon, tray, waffle. The robot should NOT attempt to move these object categories. I would like the robot to only interact with the specified objects and fixtures, and only use the robot skills specified.

Can you suggest some tasks for me that follow the constraints listed above? Tasks should only require 3-10 skills.

Your tasks should reflect common everyday human activities in the kitchen, such as arranging objects by type, preparing something, shifting objects around, etc. Make sure that each of the tasks also makes logical sense.

For each task, follow the following format:
Task: short descriptive title for task
Goal: short description of task goals
Objects: list of objects involved in the task
Fixtures: list of fixtures involved in the task
Skills: sequence of skills needed to solve task (This should clearly defined as the sequence of skills we need to compose to solve the task)
Reasoning: why this is an interesting task that reflects everyday human activities in kitchen environments

Here are some examples of good tasks following this format. These are examples for different activities. Make sure the tasks you generate are for the activity of washing dishes.

The tasks you give need to be tasks that allow the robot to manipulate different objects in its environment. The task should make sense, but make sure to focus more on the manipulation of objects. Also do not repeat any of the good tasks mentioned above. Tasks should be unique. Try to have tasks do more than just picking and placing objects. Be creative with the tasks and make sure they are all diverse and doing different things. Think "what are some of the steps a human might take to do the given activity"?

Write 40 tasks that require 3-10 skills that involve washing dishes. You should have fifteen tasks that require 3-4 skills, fifteen tasks that require 5-7 skills, and ten tasks that require 8-10 skills. Tasks that you create should use the sink, stove, microwave, and cabinet fixtures. You should have at least two tasks for each of the fixtures listed above. Make sure to also use a variety of objects.
Give me all tasks at once, don't prompt me in the middle asking for more tasks.
