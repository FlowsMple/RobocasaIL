PROMPT: 

Your goal is to come up with 30 unique tasks that all fall under the activity of washing dishes.
The tasks you come up with do not have to do the entire activity. They can instead prep for the activity or do something for when the activity is completed.

Finally, the kitchen has the following fixtures: counters, cabinets, drawers, stove, microwave, sink, coffee machine, blender, refrigerator, dishwasher

Your tasks should reflect common everyday human behaviors in kitchen environments, such as arranging objects by type, preparing something, shifting objects around, etc.
The tasks must only use the objects, skills, and fixtures listed above.
The tasks should be unique, relevant, and make logical sense.
Be creative with the tasks and make sure they are all diverse and doing different things.
Try to have tasks involve more than just picking and placing a specificed set of objects, and instead involve tasks that require semantic reasoning.

For each task, follow the following format:

Skills: a clearly defined sequence of skills needed to solve the task. for each skill reference the objects, fixtures, and environment states invovled.
Reasoning: why this is an interesting and representative task for washing dishes

Write 30 tasks that require 3-10 skills that feature washing dishes.
You should have ten tasks that require 3-4 skills, ten tasks that require 5-7 skills, and ten tasks that require 8-10 skills.
