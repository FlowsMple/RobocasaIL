PROMPT: 

Your goal is to come up with 40 unique tasks that all fall under the activity of washing dishes.
The tasks you come up with do not have to do the entire activity. They can instead prep for the activity or do something for when the activity is completed.
Your tasks MUST adhere to the constraints listed below.

Here's some information about the kitchen.

In the kitchen, you have vegetables, fruits, bread, packaged food, cleaner, drinks, receptacles, utensils, sweets, decorations, dairy, condiments, pastries, cooked food, meat, and tools.

You can interact with objects in the kitchen using the following skills:
- pick and place. eg: pick a vegetable from the cabinet and place it into the bowl
- opening / closing doors. eg. open the cabinet door
- opening / closing drawers. eg. open the drawer right below the counter
- navigation. eg. navigating throughout the kitchen
- pressing buttons. eg. press the button on the coffee machine
- turning levers. eg: turning a sink faucet
- twisting knobs. eg: twist the stove knob to turn it on
- pushing / sweeping objects. eg. push objects across the countertop

Finally, the kitchen has the following fixtures: counters, cabinets, drawers, stove, microwave, sink, coffee machine, blender, refrigerator, dishwasher

Your tasks should reflect common everyday human behaviors in kitchen environments, such as arranging objects by type, preparing something, shifting objects around, etc.
The tasks must only use the objects, skills, and fixtures listed above.
The tasks should be unique, relevant, and make logical sense.
Be creative with the tasks and make sure they are all diverse and doing different things.
Try to have tasks involve more than just picking and placing a specificed set of objects, and instead involve tasks that require semantic reasoning.

For each task, follow the following format:
Task: short descriptive title for task
Goal: short description of task goals
Description: a full detailed description of the task, including what objects and fixtures are invovled and how they are initialized in the environment. Then provide a description of what is required to solve the task. You are encouraged to use multiple sentences and be as detailed as possible.
Objects: list of objects involved in the task
Fixtures: list of fixtures involved in the task
Skills: a clearly defined sequence of skills needed to solve the task. for each skill reference the objects, fixtures, and environment states invovled.
Reasoning: why this is an interesting and representative task for washing dishes

Write 40 tasks that require 3-10 skills that feature washing dishes.
You should have fifteen tasks that require 3-4 skills, fifteen tasks that require 5-7 skills, and ten tasks that require 8-10 skills.

Give me all 40 tasks at once. Please continue with your response without asking questions.
