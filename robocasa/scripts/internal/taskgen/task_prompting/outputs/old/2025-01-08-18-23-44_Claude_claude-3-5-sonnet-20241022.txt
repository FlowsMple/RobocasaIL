PROMPT: 

Your goal is to come up with 50 unique tasks that all fall under the activity of washing dishes.
The tasks you come up with do not have to do the entire activity. They can instead prep for the activity or do something for when the activity is completed.
Your tasks MUST adhere to the constraints listed below.

Here's some information about the kitchen.

In the kitchen, you have vegetables, fruits, bread, packaged food, cleaner, drinks, receptacles, utensils, sweets, decorations, dairy, condiments, pastries, cooked food, meat, and tools.

You can interact with objects in the kitchen in the following ways:
- pick and place. eg: pick a vegetable from the cabinet and place it into the bowl
- opening / closing doors. eg. open the cabinet door
- opening / closing drawers. eg. open the drawer right below the counter
- navigation. eg. navigating throughout the kitchen
- pressing buttons. eg. press the button on the coffee machine
- turning levers. eg: turning a sink faucet
- twisting knobs. eg: twist the stove knob to turn it on
- pushing / sweeping objects. eg. push objects across the countertop

Finally, the kitchen has the following fixtures:
- counters
- cabinets and drawers: come with doors that can be opened and closed
- one stove: comes with functional knobs to turn on individual burners
- one microwave: comes with a door that can be opened and closed
- one sink: comes with functional faucet lever and spout. can be turned on, with water running out the tap
- one coffee machine: can be turned on, with coffee dripping out of nozzle
- one blender: the blender has a button that can be pressed, but we are not able to open or close the lid
- one refrigerator
- one dishwasher

Your tasks should reflect common everyday human activities in the kitchen, such as arranging objects by type, preparing something, shifting objects around, etc.
The tasks must only use the objects, skills, and fixtures listed above.
The tasks should be unique, relevant, and make logical sense.
Be creative with the tasks and make sure they are all diverse and doing different things.
Try to have tasks involve more than just picking and placing a specificed set of objects, and instead involve tasks that require semantic reasoning.

For each task, follow the following format:
Task: short descriptive title for task
Goal: short description of task goals
Objects: list of objects involved in the task
Fixtures: list of fixtures involved in the task
Skills: sequence of skills needed to solve task (This should clearly defined as the sequence of skills we need to compose to solve the task)
Reasoning: why this is an interesting and representative task for washing dishes

Write 50 tasks that require 3-10 skills that feature washing dishes.
You should have twenty tasks that require 3-4 skills, twenty tasks that require 5-7 skills, and ten tasks that require 8-10 skills.
Give me all tasks at once, don't prompt me in the middle asking for more tasks.
