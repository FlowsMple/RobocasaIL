Your goal is to come up with 10 unique tasks that a robot can complete that use the counter. Each of the tasks you generate should be something that can be done in the kitchen and uses the skills and objects listed below. Also, your tasks MUST adhere to the constraints listed below.

Here's some information about the kitchen.

In the kitchen, you have the following types of objects:
- vegetable: avocado, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, broccoli, carrot, garlic, lemon, lime, mushroom, onion, corn, eggplant, potato, squash, sweet potato
- fruit: apple, banana, kiwi, mango, orange, peach, pear, tangerine
- bread: baguette, bagel, bread
- packaged food: bar, boxed food, canned food, cereal, bagged food, chips, jam
- cleaner: bar soap, soap dispenser, sponge, spray
- drink: bottled drink, boxed drink, liquor, beer, can, water bottle, wine
- receptacle: bowl, mug, cutting board, jug, kettle, mug, pan, plate, cup, jug, teapot, tray
- utensil: fork, knife, ladle, spatula, spoon
- sweets: cake, chocolate, donut, cupcake, waffle
- decoration: candle
- dairy: cheese, egg, milk, yogurt
- condiment: condiment bottle, ketchup, shaker
- pastry: croissant
- cooked food: hot dog
- meat: fish, steak
- tool: rolling pin, scissors
Each object is categorized. In the tasks you create, you should consider a family of objects. In other words, a task should not focus on a specific object like a tomato or knife. Instead, the task should be able to be generalized to a group of objects like vegetable or condiment. The only exception to this is when using receptacles. Also note that you cannot change these objects by cutting them, chopping them, breaking them, burning them, etc. We can ONLY move these objects around by picking, placing, or pushing them.

In addition, the robot only has the following skills:
- pick and place. eg: pick a vegetable from the cabinet and place it into the bowl
- opening and closing doors. eg. open the cabinet door
- opening and closing drawers. eg. open the drawer right below the counter
- navigation. eg. navigating throughout the kitchen
- insertion: eg: inserting a canned item in the drawer
- pressing buttons. eg. press the microwave door
- turning levers. eg: turning a sink faucet
- twisting knobs. eg: twist the stove knob to turn it on
- flipping switches. eg: turn on light switch
- pushing / sweeping objects. eg. push objects across the countertop
Make sure to design tasks that can be completed using the skills listed. These are the only skills the robot knows. If the task you come up with requires another skill, it will not be valid. 

Finally, the kitchen has the following fixtures:
- counters
- cabinets and drawers: come with doors that can be opened and closed
- one stove: comes with functional knobs to turn on individual burners
- one microwave: comes with a door that can be opened and closed
- one sink: comes with functional faucet lever and spout. can be turned on, with water running out the tap
- one toaster: we can insert objects into toaster
Your kitchen only has these fixtures. If the task you generate uses a fixture not listed above, the task will be considered invalid. Note that the kitchen does not have a refrigerator, oven, blender, or grill. All the tasks you generate must use the microwave. Feel free to use other listed fixtures in your tasks as well. 

Each task should do a unique thing. Once again, the tasks must only use the objects, skills, and fixtures listed above. These tasks should be simple enough to be done by a robot.

Eventually, I would like to model these tasks in a simulated kitchen environment with a robot attempting to complete the task. The robot is an arm that is mounted on a base and can move around the kitchen and manipulate different items. When suggesting these tasks it's very important to follow these constraints:

1. The simulator does not yet support deformable objects, such as liquids, bags, and towels. As a result, the robot cannot manipulate soft bodies, such as cutting objects, pouring liquids, or folding clothes.

2. Most object categories are graspable, meaning the robot can pick them up. However, the following objects are not graspable: bagel, bagged food, bread, chips, chocolate, cutting board, fork, knife, plate, scissors, spatula, spoon, tray, waffle. The robot should NOT attempt to move these object categories. I would like the robot to only interact with the specified objects and fixtures, and only use the robot skills specified.

Can you suggest some tasks for me that follow the constraints listed above? Remeber that each of the tasks must use a counter. Your tasks should do stuff like categorizing objects by type, preparing something, shifting objects around, etc. Make sure that each of the tasks also makes logical sense. 

Here are some example of good tasks and why they are good.

Task: The robot picks up meat, dairy, fruits and bread from different cabinets and arranges them on a tray on the counter.
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and place, Navigation
Fixtures: Cabinets, Counter
Objects: Meat, Dairy, Fruits, Bread, Tray
Reasoning: This task utilizes a lot of different objects and is also placing everything on the counter.

Task: Place all the fruits on the counter in a receptacle on the counter
Skills: Pick and place
Fixtures: Counter
Objects: Fruits, receptacle
Reasoning: This task is good because it uses mulitple objects. Also fruits can be replaced with any other type of food.

Task: Arrange the sweets in the shape of a pyramid on the counter.
Skills: Pick and place
Fixtures: Counter
Objects: Sweets
Reasoning: This is a very good task as it involves doing something interesting with the objects

Here are some examples of bad tasks: 

Task: Shift all utensils from the drawer onto a tray on the counter.
Skills: Opening and Closing drawers, Pick and place, Navigation
Fixtures: Drawers, Counter
Objects: Utensils, Tray
Reasoning: Utensils cannot be grasped

The tasks you give don't have to be tasks that a human typically does. They just need to be tasks that allow the robot to manipulate different objects in its environment and still do need to make sense to do. The task should make sense, but make sure to focus more on the manipulation of objects and using the counter in some form. Also do not repeat any of the good tasks mentioned above. 

Write 10 tasks that involve doing stuff on the counter. Your tasks should not just move things from one place onto the counter. Instead, focus on having the robot do something on the countertop. Try to focus on arranging the objects in interesting ways. For the purpose of generating tasks, assume all your objects are originally on the counter and you only want to manipulate them for some task.
