Your goal is to make 10 tasks that can be completed in the kitchen using the skills and objects listed below. Also, your tasks MUST adhere to the constraints listed below as well.

Here are the ONLY skills you can use to complete your task. You are NOT able to use any other skills. If your task uses other skills, it will be considered invalid.
- pick and place. eg: pick a vegetable from the cabinet and place it into the bowl
- opening and closing doors. eg. open the cabinet door
- opening and closing drawers. eg. open the drawer right below the counter
- opening and closing lids. eg. open the coffee machine lid
- navigation. eg. navigating throughout the kitchen
- insertion: eg: inserting a coffee pod into a coffee machine
- pressing buttons. eg. press the microwave door
- turning levers. eg: turning a sink faucet
- twisting knobs. eg: twist the stove knob to turn it on
- flipping switches. eg: turn on light switch
- pushing / sweeping objects. eg. push objects across the countertop

The kitchen you have has the following parts. These parts can be interacted with using ONLY the skills listed above.
- counters.
- cabinets and drawers: come with doors that can be opened and closed.
- one stove: comes with functional knobs to turn on individual burners.
- one microwave: comes with a door that can be opened and closed.
- one sink: comes with functional faucet lever and spout. can be turned on, with water running out the tap.
- one coffee machine: has a coffee pod holder which we can place coffee pods into.
- one toaster: we can insert objects into toaster.

One thing to note is that this kitchen does NOT have a refrigerator or dishwasher! The kitchen also only has the following objects:
- vegetable: avocado, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, broccoli, carrot, garlic, lemon, lime, mushroom, onion, corn, eggplant, potato, squash, sweet potato
- fruit: apple, banana, kiwi, mango, orange, peach, pear, tangerine
- bread: baguette, bagel, bread
- packaged food: bar, boxed food, canned food, cereal, bagged food, chips, jam
- cleaner: bar soap, soap dispenser, sponge, spray
- drink: bottled drink, boxed drink, liquor, beer, can, coffee cup, water bottle, wine
- receptacle: bowl, mug, coffee cup, cutting board, jug, kettle, mug, pan, plate, cup, jug, teapot, tray
- utensil: fork, knife, ladle, spatula, spoon
- sweets: cake, chocolate, donut, cupcake, waffle
- decoration: candle
- dairy: cheese, egg, milk, yogurt
- condiment: condiment bottle, ketchup, shaker
- pastry: croissant
- cooked food: hot dog
- meat: fish, steak
- tool: rolling pin, scissors
- misc: coffee pod
You may only use these objects. Note that we cannot change these objects by cutting them, breaking them, burning them, etc. We can ONLY move these objects around.

Eventually, I would like to model these tasks in a simulated kitchen environment with a robot. The robot is an arm that is mounted on a base and can move around the kitchen and manipulate different items. When suggesting these tasks it's very important to adhere to these constraints:

The simulator does not yet support deformable objects, such as liquids, bags, and towels. As a result, the robot cannot manipulate soft bodies, such as cutting objects, pouring liquids, or folding clothes.

Most object categories are graspable, meaning the robot can pick them up. However, the following categories are not graspable: bagel, bagged food, bread, chips, chocolate, cutting board, fork, knife, plate, scissors, spatula, spoon, tray, waffle. The robot should NOT attempt to move these object categories. I would like the robot to only interact with the specified objects and fixtures, and only use the robot skills specified.

Can you suggest some everyday tasks that involve five or more of the mentioned skills to perform while adhering to the constraints mentioned above? One of the tasks should involve using the stove, one should involve using the sink, and one should involve using the microwave. Additionally, your tasks should use a good mix of the objects provided. Once again, you are NOT allowed to use any other objects or skills. Also include where the objects are located at the start of the task. Be SPECIFIC!

Briefly provide details about the objects, fixtures, and skills involved. Here are some examples of good and valid tasks:

Organizing the Pantry
Skills: Pick and place, opening and closing doors, pushing/sweeping objects.
Objects & Fixtures: Cabinet, packaged food items (e.g., bar, boxed food, canned food, cereal).
Task Description: The robot sorts and organizes pantry items. It navigates to a cabinet, opens the door, and uses pick and place to move the packaged food items inside, neatly arranging them by pushing/sweeping them to the back to maximize space.

Beverage Preparation for Guests
Skills: Pick and place, opening and closing lids, pressing buttons, twisting knobs.
Objects & Fixtures: Cabinet, kettle, tea or coffee pods, mug, sink.
Task Description: The robot opens a cabinet to retrieve a tea bag or coffee pod and a mug. It navigates to the sink, fills the kettle with 'water' (simulated) by twisting the faucet lever, and places the kettle onto the stove. The robot twists the stove knob to simulate boiling the 'water'. It then places the tea bag or coffee pod into the mug.
