Your goal is to come up with 10 unique tasks that a robot can complete that use the stove. Each of the task you generate should be something that can be done in the kitchen and uses the skills and objects listed below. Also, your tasks MUST adhere to the constraints listed below.

Here's some information about the kitchen.

In the kitchen, you have the following types of objects:
- vegetable: avocado, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, broccoli, carrot, garlic, lemon, lime, mushroom, onion, corn, eggplant, potato, squash, sweet potato
- fruit: apple, banana, kiwi, mango, orange, peach, pear, tangerine
- bread: baguette, bagel, bread
- packaged food: bar, boxed food, canned food, cereal, bagged food, chips, jam
- cleaner: bar soap, soap dispenser, sponge, spray
- drink: bottled drink, boxed drink, liquor, beer, can, water bottle, wine
- receptacle: bowl, mug, cutting board, jug, kettle, mug, pan, plate, cup, jug, teapot, tray
- utensil: fork, knife, ladle, spatula, spoon
- sweets: cake, chocolate, donut, cupcake, waffle
- decoration: candle
- dairy: cheese, egg, milk, yogurt
- condiment: condiment bottle, ketchup, shaker
- pastry: croissant
- cooked food: hot dog
- meat: fish, steak
- tool: rolling pin, scissors
Each object is categorized. In the tasks you create, you should consider a family of objects. In other words, a task should not focus on a specific object like a tomato or knife. Instead, the task should be able to be generalized to a group of objects like vegetable or condiment. The only exception to this is when using receptacles. Also note that you cannot change these objects by cutting them, chopping them, breaking them, burning them, etc. We can ONLY move these objects around by picking, placing, or pushing them.

In addition, the robot only has the following skills:
- pick and place. eg: pick a vegetable from the cabinet and place it into the bowl
- opening and closing doors. eg. open the cabinet door
- opening and closing drawers. eg. open the drawer right below the counter
- navigation. eg. navigating throughout the kitchen
- insertion. eg: inserting a canned item in the drawer
- pressing buttons. eg. press the microwave door
- turning levers. eg: turning a sink faucet
- twisting knobs. eg: twist the stove knob to turn it on
- flipping switches. eg: turn on light switch
- pushing / sweeping objects. eg. push objects across the countertop
Make sure to design tasks that can be completed using the skills listed. These are the only skills the robot knows. If the task you come up with requires another skill, it will not be valid. 

Finally, the kitchen has the following fixtures:
- counters
- cabinets and drawers: come with doors that can be opened and closed
- one stove: comes with functional knobs to turn on individual burners
- one microwave: comes with a door that can be opened and closed
- one sink: comes with functional faucet lever and spout. can be turned on, with water running out the tap
- one toaster: we can insert objects into toaster
Your kitchen only has these fixtures. If the task you generate uses a fixture not listed above, the task will be considered invalid. Note that the kitchen does not have a refrigerator, oven, blender, or grill. All the tasks you generate must use the stove. Feel free to use other listed fixtures in your tasks as well. 

Each task should do a unique thing. Once again, the tasks must only use the objects, skills, and fixtures listed above. These tasks should be simple enough to be done by a robot.

Eventually, I would like to model these tasks in a simulated kitchen environment with a robot attempting to complete the task. The robot is an arm that is mounted on a base and can move around the kitchen and manipulate different items. When suggesting these tasks it's very important to follow these constraints:

1. The simulator does not yet support deformable objects, such as liquids, bags, and towels. As a result, the robot cannot manipulate soft bodies, such as cutting objects, pouring liquids, or folding clothes.

2. Most object categories are graspable, meaning the robot can pick them up. However, the following objects are not graspable: bagel, bagged food, bread, chips, chocolate, cutting board, fork, knife, plate, scissors, spatula, spoon, tray, waffle. The robot should NOT attempt to move these object categories. I would like the robot to only interact with the specified objects and fixtures, and only use the robot skills specified.

Can you suggest some tasks for me that follow the constraints listed above? 

Your tasks should be a good mix of easy, medium, and hard difficulty. Easy difficulty tasks only require one skill and are straightforward. Hard difficulty tasks usually involve multiple different fixtures and more than one skill. 

Remeber that each of the tasks must use a stove. Your tasks should do stuff like categorizing objects by type, filling up receptable with water, preparing something, shifting objects around, etc. Make sure that each of the tasks also makes logical sense. 

Here are some example of good tasks and why they are good.

Task: Take a pan from the counter and place it on the stove.
Objects: Pan
Fixtures: Stove, counter
Skills: pick and place
Reasoning: This is a very simple task that a human would do.

Task: Take the vegetables on the stove and place them on the plate on the counter. When all the vegetables are removed, turn off the stove.
Objects: Pan, vegetables, plate
Fixtures: Stove, counter
Skills: pick and place
Reasoning: This is a medium difficulty task that involves that involves using the stove functionality.

Task: Take the electric kettle on the counter and put it in the sink. Turn the sink on to simulate filling up the kettle. Then, after some time, turn the sink off. Move the kettle to the stove and turn on the stove.
Objects: kettle
Fixtures: Stove, sink
Skills: pick and place, turning levers, navigation, twisting knobs
Reasoning: This is a hard difficulty task as it involves multiple steps and skills. This is considered a good long horizon task.

The tasks you give don't have to be tasks that a human typically does. They just need to be tasks that allow the robot to manipulate different objects in its environment and still do need to make sense to do. The task should make sense, but make sure to focus more on the manipulation of objects and using the stove in some form. Also do not repeat any of the good tasks mentioned above. 

Write 10 easy tasks that use the stove. You can write tasks where the stove you need to turn on or turn off the stove. You can also put things on the stove or take them off and you can move stuff around on the stove too.
