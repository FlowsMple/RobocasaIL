Your goal is to give 10 unique and good tasks that can be completed in the kitchen using the skills and objects listed below. Also, your tasks MUST adhere to the constraints listed below as well. These tasks should be unique enough that they do not just use different objects in the same group of objects (i.e. one variation of the task uses apples and another uses bananas). Instead, each task should utilize a different set of groups of objects. When writing the tasks, only consider the family of objects. For instance, a task should involves fruits, NOT apples, bananas, oranges, etc.

The kitchen ONLY has the following families of objects. We also include the actual objects for reference when coming up with appropriate tasks. Your tasks should only utilize the category/family of objects, NOT the actual objects. However, keep in mind that you only have access to the actual objects. As such do not create a task that requires an object not listed below:
- vegetable: avocado, cucumber, tomato, bell pepper, broccoli, carrot, garlic, lemon, lime, mushroom, onion, corn, eggplant, - - potato, squash, sweet potato
- fruit: apple, banana, kiwi, mango, orange, peach, pear, tangerine
- bread: baguette, bagel, bread
- packaged food: bar, boxed food, canned food, cereal, bagged food, chips, jam
- cleaner: bar soap, soap dispenser, sponge, spray
- drink: bottled drink, boxed drink, liquor, beer, can, water bottle, wine
- receptacle: bowl, mug, coffee cup, cutting board, jug, kettle, mug, pan, plate, cup, jug, teapot, tray
- utensil: fork, knife, ladle, spatula, spoon
- sweets: cake, chocolate, donut, cupcake, waffle
- decoration: candle
- dairy: cheese, egg, milk, yogurt
- condiment: condiment bottle, ketchup, shaker
- pastry: croissant
- cooked food: hot dog
- meat: fish, steak
- tool: rolling pin, scissors
- misc: coffee pod

You may ONLY use these family of objects. Note that you cannot change these objects by cutting them, chopping them, breaking them, burning them, etc. We can ONLY move these objects around by picking, placing, or pushing them.

Also, here are the ONLY skills you can use to complete your task. You are NOT able to use any other skills. If your task uses other skills, it will be considered invalid.
- pick and place. eg: pick a vegetable from the cabinet and place it into the bowl
- opening and closing doors. eg. open the cabinet door
- opening and closing drawers. eg. open the drawer right below the counter
- opening and closing lids. eg. open the coffee machine lid
- navigation. eg. navigating throughout the kitchen
- insertion: eg: inserting a coffee pod into a coffee machine
- pressing buttons. eg. press the microwave door
- turning levers. eg: turning a sink faucet
- twisting knobs. eg: twist the stove knob to turn it on
- flipping switches. eg: turn on light switch
- pushing / sweeping objects. eg. push objects across the countertop

The kitchen you have has the following fixtures. These parts can be interacted with using ONLY the skills listed above.
- counters.
- cabinets and drawers: come with doors that can be opened and closed.
- one stove: comes with functional knobs to turn on individual burners.
- one microwave: comes with a door that can be opened and closed.
- one sink: comes with functional faucet lever and spout. can be turned on, with water running out the tap.
- one toaster: we can insert objects into toaster.

You kitchen ONLY has these fixtures. If you use a fixutre not listed above, the task will be considered invalid. Note that the kitchen does NOT have a grill, oven, refrigerator, or blender.

All the tasks you create MUST only utilize a subset of these object families, skills, and fixtures.

Eventually, I would like to model these tasks in a simulated kitchen environment with a robot attempting to complete the task. The robot is an arm that is mounted on a base and can move around the kitchen and manipulate different items. When suggesting these tasks it's very important to adhere to these constraints:

The simulator does not yet support deformable objects, such as liquids, bags, and towels. As a result, the robot cannot manipulate soft bodies, such as cutting objects, pouring liquids, or folding clothes.

Most object categories are graspable, meaning the robot can pick them up. However, the following categories are not graspable: bagel, bagged food, bread, chips, chocolate, cutting board, fork, knife, plate, scissors, spatula, spoon, tray, waffle. The robot should NOT attempt to move these object categories. I would like the robot to only interact with the specified objects and fixtures, and only use the robot skills specified.

Can you suggest some unique everyday tasks that involve five or more of the mentioned skills to perform while adhering to the constraints mentioned above? Additionally, your tasks should use a good mix of the objects families, fixtures, and skills provided. Once again, you are NOT allowed to use any other objects or skills. Also include where the objects are located at the start of the task. Be SPECIFIC!

Briefly provide details about the object families, fixtures, and skills involved. Here are some example tasks.

Here are some examples of good tasks:

Task: Arranging Fruit Bowl
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and place, Navigation
Fixtures: Cabinets, Counter
Objects: Receptacle (Bowl), Fruits
Task Description: The robot navigates to the cabinet, picks up various fruits and place them neatly in the bowl placed on the counter.
Locations: Fruits are located in the cabinets and bowl is on the counter.
Reasoning: standard preparation task that can be modified for more interesting tasks

Task: Microwave Setup
Skills: Opening and closing cabinets, Pick and place, Navigation, Pressing buttons
Fixtures: Cabinets, Microwave
Objects: Packaged food
Task Description: The robot navigates to the cabinet, picks up packaged food and places it inside the microwave. It then presses the right buttons to start the microwave process.
Locations: Packaged food is located in the cabinets.
Reasoning: simple but can have a lot of diversity with the objects we put in the microwave

Task: Cleaning Countertop 
Skills: Pick and place, Navigation, Pushing/sweeping objects
Fixtures: Counters
Objects: Cleaner, Misc
Task Description: The robot picks up the cleaner and navigates to the counters. It then pushes or sweeps the counters using the cleaner.
Locations: Cleaner is located on the counter.
Reasoning: task is unique and can include any objects

Task: Setting Up Afternoon Tea
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and place, Navigation, Twisting knobs
Fixtures: Cabinets, Microwave
Objects: Pastry, Tea (Packaged food), Receptacle (Teapot, Cups)
Task Description: The robot picks up pastry and a teapot from cabinets, heats water on the stove for tea and places all items neatly on the counter.
Locations: Pastry, Tea, Receptacle (Teapot, Cups) are located in the cabinets.
Reasoning: good mix of objects and skills

Task: Prepping Hot Sandwich
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and place, Navigation, Insertion, Twisting knobs
Fixtures: Cabinets, Toaster
Objects: Bread, Meat, Dairy
Task Description: The robot navigates to the cabinet, picks up a slice of bread, meat, and cheese. It places these in the toaster and adjusts the toaster setting by twisting the knobs.

Reasoning: uses skills and objects that we know or have

Task: Making a Charcuterie Board
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and place, Navigation
Fixtures: Cabinets, Counter
Objects: Meat, Dairy, Fruits, Bread and Receptacle (Board)
Task Description: The robot picks up meat, dairy, fruits and bread from different cabinets and arranges them on a board on the counter.
Locations: Meat, Dairy, Fruits, and Bread are located in the cabinets and the charcuterie board is on the counter.
Reasoning: this involves a good set of skills and also object families where we can choose different objects in said family.

Here are some examples of bad tasks:

Task: Restocking the Fridge
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and Place, Navigation
Fixtures: Cabinets, Refrigerator
Objects: Dairy, Meat, Drinks, Fruits, Vegetables
Task Description: The robot has to pick up various food items such as dairy, meat, drinks, fruits, and vegetables from the cabinets and place them in the refrigerator.
Locations: All items are located inside the cabinets.
Reasoning: we do not have a refrigerator

Task: Toast Preparation
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and place, Navigation, Insertion, Twisting knobs
Fixtures: Cabinets, Toaster, Stove
Objects: Bread, Butter (Dairy), Jam (Sweets)
Task Description: The robot navigates to the cabinet, picks bread slices and places them in the toaster. It also twists the knob to adjust the heat level of the toaster. 
Locations: Bread, Butter, and Jam are located in the cabinet.
Reasoning: jam is not a category of objects

Task: Prepping Hot Cocoa
Skills: Opening and closing doors, Pick and place, Navigation, Insertion, Pressing buttons
Fixtures: Cabinets, Coffee Machine
Objects: Packaged food(Cocoa pods)
Task Description: The robot navigates to the cabinet, picks up a cocoa pod from inside, inserts it into the coffee machine and presses the buttons to get it started.
Locations: Cocoa pods are located in the cabinets.
Reasoning: we do not have cocoa pods

Tasks need to be unique in that they do not accomplish similar things. For instance, tasks like "Preparing Dinner Table" and "Preparing Breakfast Corner" are NOT relatively unique since they both have to do with preparing something and simply involve moving similar food to the table. Here is a set of example tasks that are unqiue from each other:

Preparing Dinner Table, Cleaning the Kitchen Table, Stocking up the Refrigerator

Once again, your goal is to give 10 UNIQUE GOOD tasks. Try to use between 4-6 skills for each tasks and use a plethora of object families. Also, you should use each skill and each feature at least once in your list of tasks. Your set of tasks will be considered invalid if you don't use each fixture and each skill at least once. Be creative and make sure to adhere to all the contrainsts listed above. Your primary goal is for TASK DIVERSITY. Come up with unique tasks that do different and interesting things. Also, please include a reasoning as to why the task is good. A task can be good for a number of reasons:

- utilizes a good number of skills, about 5 or more
- utilizes many object families, about 4 or more
- is unique and very interesting
- can be modified, for instance tasks involving a bowl can use multiple bowls for separation of objects

These are just a small number of reasons. Feel free to come up with  more reason why a task might be good. Similarly, a task can be bad for a few a reasons:

- Doesn't follow the constraints of the simulators
- Uses object or object categories that are not listed
- Uses skills that are not listed
- Uses fixtures that aren't listed
- Is not unique or is similar to one of the other tasks

After writing each tasks. Consider if the task is a good task or a bad task and include your reasoning. Also, for each object, write if it is included in the list given above and which family it is under. Your goal is to come up with 10 UNIQUE and GOOD tasks. Each of the tasks MUST use a stove. Feel free to use other fixtures given, however, every single task must use a stove in some fashion.
